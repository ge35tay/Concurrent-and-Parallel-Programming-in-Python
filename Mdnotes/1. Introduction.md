# 1. Introduction

Program is usually running sequentially on one CPU, the other is sitting idle.

 We can separate different threads to do different tasks to decrease waiting time and speed up.





Python Considerations:

- Global Interpreter Lock:

  - Only one thread can be running at one time, it is not concurrent, but take turns, whenever one is idle, another one can jump in and take the CPU time

- Thread safe

  - Locking
  - An entity can handle multiple threads using it or threads deal with data in a way that doesn't interfere with other threads

- Race condition

  - Need avoid weird case when two thread want to access the shared data
  - Thread 1 accesses and writes to/modifies variable a
  - Thread 2 accesses and writes to/modifies variable b
  - Unpredictable result would happen
  - If we have shared data, need to consider race condition



1. Threads:
   1. Share the same memory
   2. Small overhead associated with thread switching and management
2. Multiprocessing
   1. Processes don't share memory. each process has its own python interpreter and GIL
   2. Hight overhead, memory duplication
3. Concurrency in general:
   1. More complex and hard to debug



## 1. Threading

The thread does not improve the time a lot, because basically it is still run sequently, but the sleeping happens in a thread level, a different thread can execute while each of these threads is sitting idle



- use a separate list to save the thread and use the .join outside the loop to block the whole execution until this thread is done (if u put inside the loop it blocks every loop execution, and the performance is not improved) 

- daemon flag: this statement means this thread, if the main program finishes, the daemon thread would no  finish
